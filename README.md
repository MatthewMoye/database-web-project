We developed a website called The Clean Infrastructure Deployment System, or otherwise known as C.I.D.S. It is meant is to help manage the deployment and progress towards completion of projects across a nation. CIDS will be an online database where an admin user can interact with the database. They can view, update, and add to the database in certain areas that are needed.

We used JDBC to communicate with a MySQL database and hosted the server using Apache Tomcat.
